This project is built using Next.js, a powerful React framewrok. It is to showcase the students ability to implement a Next.js based website and deploy it 
on Vercel. This project website is an interactive website with both frontend and backend capabilities that allows users to post, comment, and like posts as well as log in and verification
features and allows users to create a new account. It also provides a user interface for the admin with its own dashboard.
